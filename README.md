Player Projectiles

This lesson will add in player projectiles and refactor the enemy kill code.  Please use your game file from last time with the new changes in the python_functions12 file found here.  Then watch the video and make changes to the game file as I am walking through it in the video.  If you get stuck the finished game file is game1.12.py.

You will also have to download the SwordProjectile.png and Sound File that is used in the updated python_functions file.

Extension -

Challenge -
1. Make another item such as Link's Boomerang or Arrow and program this projectile.  Note you will have to find another button to fire this secondary projectile.
